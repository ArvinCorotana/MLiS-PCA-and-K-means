Pre-processing:

PCA:
1:Calculate mean, variance & std of each raw feature (DONE)
2.Normalise dataset to center data around mean
3.Perform the PCA process
4.Print out the vector of means after normalisation
5.Print out the covariance matrix (9x9)
6.Print out all 9 eigenvalues
7.Print out all 9 eigenvectors in their sorted order
8.Use Scree plot to determine how many PC should be selected (Kaiser rule: pick PCs with eigenvalues of at least 1)
9.Print loadings of each feature on all the chosen PCs.
10.Print scores of all chosen PCs
11.If we end up with 3 PCs like in the paper,create multiple 2D biplots, each representing a pair of principal components (PC1 vs PC2, PC1 vs PC3, PC2 vs PC3)
        Each plot shows the data points projected onto the two selected principal components and shows 9 arrows to represent the loadings of each original feature on the
        principal components. The direction of an arrow shows the direction of a feature's maximum variance, and its length indicates the strength of the feature's influence
        on that component. In the plot we will have the data points coloured differently according to the class they belong to.
12. Finally, if indeed we end up with 3 PCs, plot the data in a 3D space and indicate that there seems to be 2 clusters like in the graph from the paper and
    conclude that we will use k-means next.

**Goal**
By analyzing the biplots, we can gain insights into which features are most important in explaining the variance in the dataset
and how those features relate to each other.
